# Reproduction and Extension of Article 3: Optimal Bayesian Estimation of Gaussian Mixtures with a Growing Number of Components

## Introduction

This project aims to reproduce and extend the work presented in the following article:

**Ohn, I. & Lin, L. (2023). Optimal Bayesian estimation of Gaussian mixtures with growing number of components. _Bernoulli_, 29(2), 1195–1218. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.3150/22-BEJ1495)**

The primary objective is to validate the theoretical results of the article by implementing the proposed methods in Python and to explore potential extensions to enhance or generalize these findings.

## Project Objectives

1. **Reproduction of Results**: Implement the algorithms described in the article to estimate Gaussian mixtures with a growing number of components. Validate the theoretical results through simulation studies.

2. **Extension of Methods**: Propose and implement improvements or generalizations of the original methods. This may include applying the methods to more complex mixture models, optimizing computational performance, or exploring new practical applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Documentation**
  - `README.md`: This documentation file.
  - `report.pdf`: Final report of approximately 5 pages summarizing the work performed and the results obtained.

- **Source Code**
  - `src/`: Contains all the Python scripts necessary for reproducing and extending the results.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration and result visualization.

- **Data**
  - `data/`: Simulated or real datasets used for analysis.

- **Results**
  - `results/`: Contains figures, tables, and other outputs generated by the scripts.

## Prerequisites

To run the project code, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- **Programming Language**: Python (version 3.8 or higher)
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `pymc3` or `stan` (for Bayesian inference)
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (if applicable)
- **Other Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook (if using notebooks)
  - Git (for version control)
