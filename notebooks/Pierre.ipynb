# Introduction

## Purpose of the Notebook

Provide an overview of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and the challenges in estimating them when the number of components is unknown and grows with sample size. Introduce the Bayesian approach for mixture models and the importance of optimal estimation. Explain that the notebook will reproduce the results of the article using different coding techniques and implementations.
